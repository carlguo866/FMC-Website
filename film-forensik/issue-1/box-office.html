				Venom has been nothing but an absolute hit at the box office. In its opening weekend, Venom earned just over $80 million, which allowed it to break the opening weekend record for October, though the recent Halloween, which opened two weeks after Venom, almost managed to overtake it with a sum of $76 million. For fall season opening weekends as a whole, Venom is beat only by 2017’s It, which had a whopping $123 million collection. 
<br><br>
To date, Venom has grabbed a cool $541 million worldwide. This may seem a low number when compared to other comic book films that opened in 2018. Black Panther was able to pull in $700 million in the United States alone with a worldwide sum of $1.3 billion, and Avengers: Infinity War made even more worldwide, making just past $2 billion. To that end, Venom may appear to be nothing remarkable. One might even think it to be disappointing.
<br><br>
However, important to the story is that Venom had a production budget of only $100 million, which is relatively small for a comic book film. Black Panther had a budget of roughly $200 million, while Avengers: Infinity War allegedly had a budget of $300 million. Also of note is that Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther take place within the beloved Marvel Cinematic Universe, whereas Venom does not, which gives those two films a leg up.
<br><br>
That being said, many Marvel Cinematic Universe films that served as a character’s first solo movie fall short of Venom’s sum. 2015’s Ant-Man made $519 million on a slightly larger budget of $130 million. 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger made only $370 million on a budget of $140 million. Thor, another 2011 film, made $449 million off of a $150 million budget. And 2008’s The Incredible Hulk made $263 million off of a $150 million budget.
<br><br>
This sets a nice precedent for Sony’s new venture into creating their own Marvel film universe, with Venom being the first entry into that series. Though Sony has had better success when making Spider-Man films, such as with Spider-Man: Homecoming which made $880 million and Spider-Man 3, which made $890 million, Spider-Man is a more popular character than Venom, which of course needs to be accounted for. And again, both of these films had budgets well over the $100 million mark. 
<br><br>
It will be interesting to see what comes of Sony’s next film in the series, Morbius. Morbius is a relatively unknown comic book character, though Jared Leto will play the titular character, which could help the film at the box office. Morbius will likely have a small budget like Venom, and possibly even lower considering the risk Sony is taking by using this character. 
<br><br>
But whatever happens with Morbius, Venom has been a success on the box office front.<br><br>
