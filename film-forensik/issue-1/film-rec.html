				The story of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a remake of the old movie Jumanji (1995), which is about animals coming into the cities, but this new movie brought it to another level. It talks about how four high school kids are sucked into a video game called Jumanji. In the game, they have three lives to spare, and the goal is to put the diamond back on top of the panther statue. They all play as the characters they chose before the game starts, and they have to fight through obstacles. In order to get out of the game, they have to change what they think of themselves.
				<br><br>
				Dwayne Johnson plays Spencer, a high school kid who lacks confidence. Spencer is Dr. Smolder Bravestone in the game, and Dr. Bravestone has enough power to determine whether their group can get out of the game. Kevin Hart plays Fridge, a high school athlete who is Franklin Finbar in the game. Fridge loses all of his physical power in Jumanji, and he has to learn how to rely on others. Karen Gillan plays Martha, a high school girl who thinks that physical education is needless, and she dislikes Fridge and Bethany. She is Ruby Roundhouse in the game. Ruby knows martial art and she is a dance fighter. Jack Black plays Bethany, a high school girl who is popular and egotistical. Bethany plays Professor Sheldon "Shelly" Oberon.
				<br><br>
				The cast did an excellent job on acting like completely different people and showing their change throughout the movie. Each character grows as the plot develops. While they clearly shows their characteristics throughout the movie, the humorous conversation and acting also bring out the best of the movie. When the players get ambushed, Dr. Bravestone (Spencer) tells Franklin (Fridge) to get on his back because Franklin can’t run fast. Franklin says, “ Nope, I would rather die.” Dr. Bravestone also gets scared when he climbs up a tree and see a squirrel.
				<br><br>
				This movie did not need as many visual effects (or VFX) as other movies made by Columbia Pictures, such as the Spiderman franchise and 2012, but the VFX team still did a phenomenal job. The hippo that appears at the beginning of the movie was done thorough VFX, and it looks like as if it is a real hippo. The alligator in the middle of the movie, trying to bite Jack Black’s feet while he is walking over the plank, also looks very realistic.
				<br><br>
				In conclusion, this movie has a good VFX, and the remade story of Jumanji with its awesome cast made it a great movie.
