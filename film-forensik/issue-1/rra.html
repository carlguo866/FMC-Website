The story starts with four alien life called “symbiotes” found in space by a corporation called “the Life Foundation”. Riot, the leader of the symbiotes, chose Riz Ahmed, the antagonist, to be the host. Venom, one of the symbiotes, chose Eddie Brock, the protagonist, to be the host. Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock tries to expose the Life Foundation because they are using human in dangerous lab experiments, causing death. Venom accidentally went into Eddie Brock, who later wants to stop Riot from going back to their planet and bringing millions of other symbiotes to Earth.<br><br>

Although it had a storyline and a conflict, It was still a knockoff from the Marvel universe. The Marvel Universe is owned by the Sony’s Picture, it is adjunct from the Marvel’s Cinematic Universe. This character was first shown in Spider-Man 3 (2007).<br><br>
The whole story also doesn’t have a smooth transition from one scene to anther. For example, an eight-year old girl with symbiote walks out of the Airport. Immediately in the next scene, she appears in the Life Foundation Lab. The same girl broke into the lab without anyone noticing after the first break in is not logical. The trailer showed the movie Venom to be more serious and dark. There still wasn’t a clear definition between who will fail and who will succeed during synthesis of symbiotes and human. In the movie, two symbiotes died during the experiment of synthesis. <br><br>

Despite the rough transition, Tom Hardy played as Eddie Brock a reporter, he did an awesome job to show the characteristics of a reporter who try to find the dark secrets of huge companies. Although Tom Hardy is a very talented actor, if the visual effect of Venom wasn’t good enough, he wouldn’t be able to give the movie into a more interesting side. The visual effect of Venom was done to perfection. Their VFX team had several talented people with Oscar Awards. The head of Venom were made using a helmet with bowl on top. <br><br>

However, there is still a reason to watch Venom “is Tom Hardy, whose amiable mugging makes a nice change from his recent manly, mush-mouthed stoicism.”( Vulture, David Edelstein, 1).  Tom Hardy not only played as the reporter Eddie Brock, he also did the voice of Venom. His humorous conversation really saved Venom from becoming a disaster.<br><br>
