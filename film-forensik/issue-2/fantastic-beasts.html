				At the end of the first film, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald was captured by the Magical Congress of the U.S.. But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings. In an effort to thwart Grindelwald's plans, Albus Dumbledore enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.

				It has always been a highly solemn experience for Harry Potter fans to appreciate a new film from the enchanting Wizarding World. However, this new fantastic beast movie is Absolutely a huge disappointment. First and foremost, there were too many foreshadows (which were designed for the following movies in the series) that makes the whole story feels like a two hours long trailer. Too many new characters and storylines, but not too many depth nor reasonable explanation for them (just like the Avengers with way too many superheros, which I personally think is a joke). For instance, Credence Barebone, the Obscurus carrier fell in love with Nagini (Voldemort's snake) and decided to find his original family completely out of the blue. On the other hand, popular new faces mentioned in the trailer like Albus Dumbledore and Leta Lestrange only showed up for very few scenes. Thus Fantastic Beasts is nothing like what’s mentioned in its trailer. It didn’t follow through a sequencing narrative. Instead, it mixed an overwhelming amount of information and hints all together to create a huge hot mess with multiple logic loopholes. Furthermore, Fantastic Beasts is no longer a film about the fantastic beasts. The shots for magical creatures in this new story were quite limited. What is worse is that these shots were also rather abrupt and unnecessary instead of intriguing or helpful for the plot’s development. Generally speaking, Fantastic Beasts has become a total commercial film both inside and out. Even though the movie itself was still a visual feast, it was certainly unable to be comparing to any of the works from Harry Potter series. It it devastating to admit this, but the old magic world where we kept our happiness and imagination is long gone now.
