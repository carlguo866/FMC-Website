		In "A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga fuse their considerable talents to depict the raw and passionate tale of Jack and Ally, two artistic souls coming together, on stage and in life. Theirs is a complex journey through the beauty and the heartbreak of a relationship struggling to survive. In this new take on the iconic love story, four-time Oscar nominee Cooper makes his directorial debut, and also stars alongside multiple award-winning, Oscar-nominated music superstar Gaga in her first leading role in a major motion picture. Cooper portrays seasoned musician Jackson Maine, who discovers and falls in love with struggling artist Ally. She has given up on her dream to become a successful singer until she meets Jack, who immediately sees her natural talent.

				A Star is born has always been on most people’s watching list ever since its first trailer being released. Now after finally watching it, I would say that most people have put expectation into the right movie. The second two main characters started singing, the movie has already met people’s expectations. Each and every one of the twenty original songs from the soundtrack was extraordinary. As usual, Lady Gaga’s delicate but at the same time powerful singing perfected the film and pushed it to a whole new level.  Meanwhile, it was also quite impressive of Cooper, the professional actor, to sing as good as an actual country-music singer with his deep low voice. Except for the music, visual effects was also a great reason why A Star is born is a worth watching in a theater. The shift between the use of colors, lightings, shots, and locations was phenomenal. Scenes like the two leads performing on stage were so well produced that they created an immersive experience for the audience and enable them to be more deeply affected. However, despite all the remarkable work the production team has done, the film still has a lot of space for improvements. The narratives were incredibly inconcise which caused the draggy and exhausting length of progression. It was also lack of a sense of coherence with all kinds of awkward connection between independent shots. Also, the plot didn't illustrate any other messages except the over-under line theme: love. Overall, I would not say that A Star is born is a marvelous motion production. Nonetheless, no one should deny the fact that it is an incredibly beautiful and touching love story with legendary musical performances.
